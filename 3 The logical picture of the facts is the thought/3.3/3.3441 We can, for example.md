3.3441 We can, for example, express what is common to all notations for the truth-functions as follows: It is common to them that they all, for example, can be replaced by the notations of "$Â¬p$" ("not $p$") and $p \lor q$ ("$p$ or $q$").

(Herewith is indicated the way in which a special possible notation can give us general information.)
