3.3 Only the proposition has sense; only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning.

[[3.31 Every part of a proposition]]
[[3.32 The sign is the part of the symbol perceptible by the senses.]]
[[3.33 In logical syntax the meaning of a sign ought never to play a role]]
[[3.34 A proposition possesses essential and accidental features.]]
