4.1252 Series which are ordered by internal relations I call formal series.

The series of numbers is ordered not by an external, but by an internal relation.

Similarly the series of propositions $aRb$,

$(\exists x):aRx.xRb$,
$(\exists x,y):aRx.xRy.yRb$, etc.

(If $b$ stands in one of these relations to $a$, I call $b$ a successor of $a$.)
