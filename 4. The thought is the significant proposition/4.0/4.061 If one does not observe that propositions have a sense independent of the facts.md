up: ['4.06 Propositions can be true or false only by being pictures of the reality.']

4.061 If one does not observe that propositions have a sense independent of the facts, one can easily believe that true and false are two relations between signs and things signified with equal rights.

One could, then, for example, say that "$p$" signifies in the true way what "$Â¬p$" signifies in the false way, etc.
