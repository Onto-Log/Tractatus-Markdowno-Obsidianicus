5.43 That from a fact  $p$ an infinite number of others should follow, namely, $¬¬p$, $¬¬¬¬p$, etc., is indeed hardly to be believed, and it is no less wonderful that the infinite number of propositions of logic (of mathematics) should follow from half a dozen "primitive propositions".

But the propositions of logic say the same thing. That is, nothing.
