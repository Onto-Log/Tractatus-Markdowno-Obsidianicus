    description of the one and only general primitive sign in logic.

up: 5.4 Here it becomes clear that there are no such things as logical objects or logical constants

5.47 It is clear that everything which can be said beforehand about the form of all propositions at all can be said on one occasion.

For all logical operations are already contained in the elementary proposition. For "$fa$" says the same as 
"$(\exists x).fx.x=a$".
Where there is composition, there is argument and function, and where these are, all logical constants already are.

One could say: the one logical constant is that which all propositions, according to their nature, have in common with one another.

That however is the general form of proposition.
