down: 5.5571 If I cannot give elementary propositions a priori then it must lead to obvious nonsense to try to give them.
up: 5.55 We must now answer a priori the question as to all possible forms of the elementary propositions.

5.557 The application of logic decides what elementary propositions there are.

But logic must have contact with its application.

Therefore logic and its application may not overlap one another.
