5.53 Identity of the object I express by identity of the sign and not by means of a sign of identity. Difference of the objects by difference of the signs.

[[5.5301 That identity is not a relation between objects is obvious.]] 

[[5.5302 Russell's definition of = won't do]]

[[5.5303 Roughly speaking to say of two things that they are identical is nonsense]]
