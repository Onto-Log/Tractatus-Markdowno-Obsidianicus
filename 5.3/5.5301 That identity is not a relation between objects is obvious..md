5.5301 That identity is not a relation between objects is obvious. This becomes very clear if, for example, one considers the proposition "$(x) : fx.\supset.x = a$". What this proposition says is simply that only $a$ satisfies the function $f$, and not that only such things satisfy the function $f$ which have a certain relation to $a$.

One could of course say that in fact only $a$ has this relation to $a$, but in order to express this we should need the sign of identity itself.
