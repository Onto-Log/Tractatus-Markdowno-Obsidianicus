up: ['6.12 The fact that the propositions of logic are tautologies shows the formal logical properties of language, of the world.']
---
6.124 The logical propositions describe the scaffolding of the world, or rather they present it.
They "treat" of nothing. They presuppose that names have meaning, and that elementary propositions have sense. And this is their connexion with the world. It is clear that it must show something about the world that certain combinations of symbols---which essentially have a definite character---are tautologies. Herein lies the decisive point. We said that in the symbols which we use much is arbitrary, much not. In logic only this expresses: but this means that in logic it is not we who express, by means of signs, what we want, but in logic the nature of the essentially necessary signs itself asserts. That is to say, if we know the logical syntax of any sign language, then all the propositions of logic are already given.
