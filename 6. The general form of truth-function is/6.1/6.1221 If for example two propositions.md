6.1221 If for example two propositions "$p$" and "$q$" give a tautology in the connexion "$p \supset q$", then it is clear that $q$ follows from $p$.

E.g. that "$q$" follows from "$p \supset q.p$" we see from these two propositions themselves, but we can also show it by combining them to "$p \supset q.p : \supset : q$" and then showing that this is a tautology.
