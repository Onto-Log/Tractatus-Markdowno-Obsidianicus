up: ['6.5 For an answer which cannot be expressed the question too cannot be expressed.']
---
6.51 Scepticism is not irrefutable, but palpably senseless, if it would doubt where a question cannot be asked.

For doubt can only exist where there is a question; a question only where there is an answer, and this only where something can be said.
