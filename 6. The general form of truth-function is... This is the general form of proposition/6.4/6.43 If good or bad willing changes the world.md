6.43 If good or bad willing changes the world, it can only change the limits of the world, not the facts; not the things that can be expressed in language.

In brief, the world must thereby become quite another, it must so to speak wax or wane as a whole.

The world of the happy is quite another than that of the unhappy.

[[6.431 As in death, too, the world does not change, but ceases.]]

[[6.432 How the world is, is completely indifferent for what is higher. God does not reveal himself in the world.]]
