 6.41 The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the world everything is as it is and happens as it does happen. In it there is no value---and if there were, it would be of no value.

If there is a value which is of value, it must lie outside all happening and being-so. For all happening and being-so is accidental.

What makes it non-accidental cannot lie in the world, for otherwise this would again be accidental.

It must lie outside the world.
