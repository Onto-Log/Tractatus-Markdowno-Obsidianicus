6.37 A necessity for one thing to happen because another has happened does not exist. There is only logical necessity.

[[6.371 At the basis of the whole modern view of the world]]

[[6.372 So people stop short at natural laws as something unassailable]]

[[6.373 The world is independent of my will.]]

[[6.374 Even if everything we wished were to happen]]

[[6.375 As there is only a logical necessity, so there is only a logical impossibility.]]
