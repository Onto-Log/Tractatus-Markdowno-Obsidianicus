6.1201 That e.g. the propositions "$p$" and "$¬ p$" in the connexion "$¬(p.¬ p)$" give a tautology shows that they contradict one another. That the propositions "$p \supset q$", "$p$" and "$q$" connected together in the form "$(p \supset q).(p):\supset:(q)$" give a tautology shows that $q$ follows from $p$ and $p \supset q$. That "$(x).fx : \supset : fa$" is a tautology shows that $fa$ follows from $(x).fx$, etc. etc.
