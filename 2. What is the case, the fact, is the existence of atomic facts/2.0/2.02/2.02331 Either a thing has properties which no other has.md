2.02331 Either a thing has properties which no other has, and then one can distinguish it straight away from the others by a description and refer to it; or, on the other hand, there are several things which have the totality of their properties in common, and then it is quite impossible to point to any one of them.
For it a thing is not distinguished by anything, I cannot distinguish it---for otherwise it would be distinguished.
