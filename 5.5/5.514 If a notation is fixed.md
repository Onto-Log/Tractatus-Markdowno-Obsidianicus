5.514 If a notation is fixed, there is in it a rule according to which all the propositions denying $p$ are constructed, a rule according to which all the propositions asserting $p$ are constructed, a rule according to which all the propositions asserting $p$ or $q$ are constructed, and so on. These rules are equivalent to the symbols and in them their sense is mirrored.
